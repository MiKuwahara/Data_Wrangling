# ðŸ§¹ Data Wrangling Lab

This project demonstrates practical data cleaning and transformation techniques using Python libraries' Pandas and Numpy.

## ðŸš€ Overview
The goal is to clean and transform raw datasets into analysis-ready data.
It focuses on handling missing values, removing duplicates, and reshaping data.

## ðŸ§  Tools & Skills
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Data cleaning & transformation
- Exploratory data analysis

## ðŸ§° Techniques Used
- `isnull()`, `value_counts()`, `replace()`, and `sum()` for missing values  
- `duplicated()` and `drop_duplicates()` for removing duplicates  
- `unique()` and `zip()` for normalizing data  

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary
After wrangling, the dataset was free of inconsistency and ready for analysis, with all duplicates removed, empty entries handled and columns standardized.
